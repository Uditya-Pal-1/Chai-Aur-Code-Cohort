  {
    q: "How does the skill gap analysis work?",

  },
  {
    q: "Is the assessment an AI judgment of my ability?",
    a: "No. It is a planning aid: it maps what your resume evidences against published role frameworks. It does not predict employability or rank you against other candidates, and every output is editable.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my resume data?",
    a: "Your resume is processed only to generate your plan, encrypted in transit and at rest, and you can export or delete everything at any time. We minimize what is sent to AI providers and never sell your data.",

    q: "Can I edit the learning path?",
